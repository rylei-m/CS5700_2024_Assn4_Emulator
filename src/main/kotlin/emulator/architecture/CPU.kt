/*
The computer executes instructions at 500hz (500 times per second)
The computer reads 2 bytes from ROM every cycle at P and P + 1 and gives them to the CPU to execute. These bytes form the instruction.
This means the P should always be an even number; operations that increment the program counter should increment it by 2
